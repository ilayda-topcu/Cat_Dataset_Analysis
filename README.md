# Cat Dataset Analysis üêæ

## Project Overview
This repository contains an analysis of a cat dataset to explore relationships between various features such as **age**, **weight**, **color**, and **breed**. The project follows a typical data science workflow:

The project focuses on answering the following key questions:
1. **Age and Weight Prediction**: Can we predict the weight of a cat based on its age? 
2. **Color and Gender Relationship**: Is there a significant relationship between the color of a cat and its gender? 
3. **Breed and Weight Distribution**: How does the weight distribution vary among different cat breeds?
