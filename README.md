# Cat Dataset Analysis üêæ

## Project Overview
This repository contains an analysis of a cat dataset to explore relationships between various features such as **age**, **weight**, **color**, and **breed**. The project follows a typical data science workflow:

1. **Defining the Problem**: Understanding key questions such as:
  - **Age and Weight Prediction**: Can we predict the weight of a cat based on its age? 
  - **Color and Gender Relationship**: Is there a significant relationship between the color of a cat and its gender? 
  - **Breed and Weight Distribution**: How does the weight distribution vary among different cat breeds? 
2. **Data Collection**: Using the provided `cat-dataset.csv`.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and summarizing the data.
4. **Modeling**: Using regression and classification models to derive insights.
5. **Reporting**: Summarizing findings and creating visualizations.

The project focuses on answering the following key questions with modelling:
  - **Age and Weight Relationship**: Logistic regression model 
  - **Color and Gender Association**: A chi-squared test
  - **Breed and Weight Distribution**: An ANOVA test
